# Quizio Frontend (beta) [Dev]

- Built using React, Typescript, and Chakra UI

### Why Typescript?
Avoid bugs and improve code quality by using Typescript. Typescript is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing to Javascript. This allows for more robust code and better developer experience.

### Why Chakra UI?
Chakra UI is a component library that is built on top of Emotion and Styled Components. It is a great library for building React applications. It is also very customizable and has a great developer experience. We won't have to worry about styling our components and can focus on building the application.

Note: This project uses eslint for linting and prettier for code formatting. Please make sure to install the eslint and prettier extensions for your code editor.

### Scripts
- `yarn start` - Start the development server

- `yarn build` - Build the application for production

- `yarn lint` - Run eslint and check for linting errors

- `yarn lint:fix` - Run eslint and fix linting errors

- `yarn format` - Run prettier and format the code
